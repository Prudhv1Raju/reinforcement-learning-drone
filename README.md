## 🧱 Discrete State

- `grid3d_env.py`: 3D grid environment with stochastic obstacles.
- `train.py`: Reinforcement learning training script using Stable-Baselines3 (DQN).
- `wrappers.py`: Custom observation wrapper for preprocessing input.

## 🌐 Continuous State

- See `codes/` folder for continuous control implementation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), AirSim, and adaptive trajectory planning.
